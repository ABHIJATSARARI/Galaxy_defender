# Galaxy_defender

Galaxy Defender is a simple HTML5 game that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is inspired by classic arcade games like Space Invaders and Galaga. The goal of the game is to defend the galaxy from a rogue AI that has taken over the space stations. You have to fight through the endless space, destroying the AI’s drones, satellites, and weapons, while protecting your allies and bases. How many enemies can you defeat?
